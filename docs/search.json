    "text": "Devin Johnson, Erin Oleson, Janelle Badger, Amanda Bradford, Jennifer McCullough\nPacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries, Honolulu, Hawaiʻi\n\nYvonne Barkley\nCooperative Institute for Marine & Atmospheric Research, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Honolulu, Hawaiʻi\n\nElizabeth Becker\nCascadia Research Collective LLC, Olympia, Washington\n\nMegan Wood\nSaltwater, Inc, Anchorage, Alaska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nSpatially-explicit density surface models (DSMs) for cetaceans have become a powerful assessment and management tool enabling examination of animal distribution and density at various scales within the modeled area. The objective of the PIFSC Cetacean Research Program’s NPS Toolbox Initiative project is to update the central Pacific and Hawaiʻi DSM framework and produce a new density model for pelagic false killer whales, and other species, using data from the 2023 Hawaiian Islands Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (HICEAS) survey. The project is using open science practices to accomplish three main objectives: (1) reformulation of the current central Pacific/Hawaiʻi DSM structure in R using upgraded spatial functionality and new modeled oceanographic products, (2) integration of new spatially-explicit methods for propagating uncertainty of detection parameters and environmental variability into stock assessments, and (3) exploration and integration of new model validation approaches, especially for data limited species. While the objectives of the CRP Toolbox project are to provide stock assessments for pelagic false killer whales in the central Pacific region, the overall goal is to provide a current, open access workflow for density surface modeling of distance sampling-based survey data that any region in NMFS can use for reproducible cetacean stock assessments. We will provide a discussion of the workflow, products, and current status of the project.\n\n\nR code\nR script files to execute the DSM analysis presented here can be found here in the the Github repository for the webpage.\n\n\nLicense\nAs a work by US federal employees as part of their official duties, this project is in the public domain within the United States of America.
